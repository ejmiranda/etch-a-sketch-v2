**Description:**
- From The Odin Project's [Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).
- Create a version of Etch-A-Sketch that allows coloring with mouse hover.
- Each square on the canvas grid is painted with a random RGB color.
- Each pass darkens the original color until it becomes black.
- Users can press `Reset` to wipe the colors and start over.
